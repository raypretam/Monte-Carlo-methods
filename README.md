# Monte-Carlo-methods

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.

I have shown some applications of the above method:

##### 1. The house always wins(monte carlo simulations).

##### 2. Finding out the value of pi(monte carlo sampling).
